Merge
Squashing is also an option when merging branches:

$ git merge --squash feature/login

Auto-merging imprint.html
Removing img/iconBlog.png
Auto-merging about.html
Squash commit -- not updating HEAD
Automatic merge went well; stopped before committing as requested
The effect is very similar to what we've discussed before: all changes will be combined just as with a normal merge - but by using the --squash option, instead of a merge commit being automatically created, you're left with local changes in your working copy which you can then commit yourself.


In the end, this allows you to avoid the automatic commit that typically happens as a result of a merge. It will appear as if the work for your feature had happened in just a single commit.
